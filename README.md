# vue-fire-examples

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Plan

- [ ] setup firebase
- [ ] setup form for signup 'authUser'
- [ ] setup vuefire
- [ ] also create 'user' document on signup ('docUser')
- [ ] somehow connect those together (pinia?)
- [ ] ensure they are always loaded before the template
- [ ] generally that they are working as well as possible

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
